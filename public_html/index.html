  <h3>Hello, my name is Brandon and I would like to welcome you to my website.</h3>
  <p>On this website I will show some parts of my life that I am proud of and would like to share with you.</p>
  <p>I definitely wonâ€™t be able to recall everything I have done in my life so far but some things that I can remember are things like my school projects, my work I have done outside of school, and other memorable things.</p>
  <p>I am a sophomore at <a href=https://nehs.4j.lane.edu/>North Eugene High School</a>. I like to go climbing at <a href=https://elevationgym.com/>Elevation</a> and workout at home when I can. Some other things I do in my free time is play video games.
  <p>I try my hardest in school to get good grades and be productive. I also really like to learn about coding and other things in school.</p>
  <p>This is a picture of an area at Elevation:</p>
