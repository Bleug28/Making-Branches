  <h3>On this page I will be showing you some coding work I have done. I have recently just started learning how to code in class and I have already built a few basic games.</h3>
  <p>I have mainly been using block coding, the website I used was <a href=http://appinventor.mit.edu/>MIT app inventor</a>.</p>
  <p>I also made some simple applications using various different things on that website.</p>
  <p>My friend and I made a ping pong type game that had multiple different pages, a slider that controlled your side, and also we made a working enemy that would defend and attack.</p>
  <p>Here are two of the main pages with the most code:</p>
