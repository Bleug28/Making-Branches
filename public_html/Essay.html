  <h3>This is my Essays page where I will be showing some of the essays I have made.</h3>
  <p>I actually sometimes enjoy making essays and just typing/writing in general.</P>
  <p>I have made a lot of essays over the years and I personally think I did a pretty good job on them, but I like to always keep improving and get better however I can.</p>
  <p>I made most of my essays using <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/?tgif=d>Google Docs</a>.</p>
  <p>This is a essay/letter we made talking about some problems and how to solve them:</p>
