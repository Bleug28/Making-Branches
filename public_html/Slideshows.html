  <h3>This will be a more complex page for me but I will be trying to show you some slideshows that I have made.</h3>
  <p>I think slideshows are cool because you can make so many different things on them and implement different things that you canâ€™t do with something like essays.</p>
  <p>I remember making quite a lot of slideshows over the years and they were usually pretty fun to make.</p>
  <p>I made most of mine using <a href=https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/?tgif=d>Google Slides</a>.</p>
  <p>This is a recent slideshow I made for Japanese:</p>
